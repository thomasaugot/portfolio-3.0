# Testing

Two tools, two jobs. Never Python — Playwright is already a Node devDependency.

| Job | Tool | Committed? |
|---|---|---|
| Pure logic: thresholds, dates, parsing | **Vitest** | yes, `tests/` |
| Real browser: does the page work | **Playwright** | yes, `e2e/` |
| "Let me look at the app" | Playwright, throwaway script | no, delete after |

## What is worth testing here

These projects are mostly presentational. Do not chase coverage.

**Test:**
- Pure business logic with real thresholds (e.g. "does the competition run today?")
- Date and timezone maths
- Parsing a third-party API response shape
- Anything where being wrong is expensive and silent

**Do not test:**
- Components, styling, animation, anything that is mostly JSX
- Context providers, hooks that only wire GSAP or Lenis
- Snapshot tests of markup — they break on every design tweak and prove nothing

## Vitest — unit

Use Vitest, not Jest. It reads the existing `tsconfig` paths (`@/`) with almost no config;
Jest needs `next/jest`, a transform, and `moduleNameMapper`.

```bash
npm i -D vitest vite-tsconfig-paths
# add @vitejs/plugin-react + jsdom ONLY if a test ever needs to render a component
```

```ts
// vitest.config.ts — verified working 2026-08-22
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config"
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tsconfigPaths()],
  test: { environment: "node", include: ["tests/**/*.test.ts"] },
})
```

`vite-tsconfig-paths` is what makes `@/` imports resolve in tests. Without it every
import fails and the usual "fix" is a wrong `alias` block in the config.

```jsonc
// package.json
"scripts": { "test": "vitest run", "test:watch": "vitest" }
```

`tests/` mirrors the source path:
`services/conditions/evaluate.ts` → `tests/services/conditions/evaluate.test.ts`

Use `environment: "node"` unless a test needs the DOM. It is much faster, and nothing
worth testing here needs a DOM.

## Playwright — E2E

Already installed. It needs a config, not an install.

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test"

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: "./e2e",
  use: { baseURL: "http://localhost:3000" },
  webServer: {
    command: "npm run dev",
    url: "http://localhost:3000",
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
})
```

Keep E2E to the few flows where breakage is expensive and silent:
- every locale route renders and returns 200
- the language switcher actually changes language (not just the URL — see 09-I18N)
- a page whose data source is flaky degrades instead of white-screening
- the mobile nav opens, traps focus, and closes on Escape

Do not E2E every section. That is a maintenance tax with no payoff.

## Looking at the app (no test file)

For "does this actually work / what does it look like / any console errors" — write a
throwaway script at the project ROOT (module resolution needs `node_modules` above it),
run it, then delete it.

```js
// .probe.mjs — delete after running
import { chromium } from "playwright"
const b = await chromium.launch()
const p = await b.newPage()
p.on("console", (m) => m.type() === "error" && console.log("ERR:", m.text()))
await p.goto("http://localhost:3000/es", { waitUntil: "networkidle" })
console.log(await p.title())
await p.screenshot({ path: "/tmp/probe.png", fullPage: true })
await b.close()
```

```bash
node ./.probe.mjs && rm .probe.mjs
```

### Two traps

**Entrance animations.** Elements are `invisible` until GSAP reveals them, so reading text
immediately after `networkidle` can return empty. Wait for the element to be visible, or
wait out the loader, before asserting on content.

**Stale `.next`.** Metadata and prerendered routes are cached. An edit to `generateMetadata`
or a route can appear to do nothing. Before concluding the code is wrong:

```bash
pkill -f next; rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache && npm run dev
```

## Rules

- Playwright is a **devDependency already** — never install a second copy, never use Python.
- Probe scripts live at the project root and are deleted after use; never commit one.
- A test that needs the app running uses Playwright's `webServer`, not a hand-rolled spawn.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run lint` are not tests, but they gate every change anyway.
