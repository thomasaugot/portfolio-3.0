# SECURITY.md — Non-negotiable Security Rules

Every rule here came from a real vulnerability found in this codebase. Do not relax any
of them "for compatibility" — that is the exact reasoning that produced each bug.

---

## Secrets — never a fallback

```ts
// ❌ BANNED — every one of these shipped to production at some point
const secret = process.env.APP_SECRET || "";
const key    = process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY || "07bc3ffd...";
const token  = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...";   // hardcoded admin JWT

// ✅ REQUIRED — fail closed, loudly, at startup
const secret = process.env.APP_SECRET;
if (!secret) throw new Error("APP_SECRET is not set. Generate: openssl rand -hex 32");
```

- A missing env var must **fail**, never silently degrade to a weaker default.
- No credential, key, JWT, or password literal in any tracked file — ever.
- A secret that reaches a public repo, an email, or an issue is **compromised**: rotate it,
  do not just delete the line. Removing it from the working tree does not remove it from
  git history.
- Never put a credential in a value that travels in a URL or an email body.

---

## API routes — every route is public until you guard it

`middleware.ts` excludes `api/*`. Nothing guards a route implicitly.

Classify every new route and apply the matching guard as the **first statement**, before
body parsing or any upstream call:

| Route kind | Guard | Helper |
|---|---|---|
| Internal / admin / cron (no frontend caller) | shared secret | `requireInternalAuth(request)` |
| Backs an authenticated admin UI (browser fetch) | session | `requireUser(request)` |
| Genuinely public (customer-facing) | rate limit | `rateLimit(request, {...})` |

```ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const unauthorized = requireInternalAuth(request);
  if (unauthorized) return unauthorized;
  ...
}
```

Guards live in `utils/api/`. Return **404, not 401**, from the internal guard so endpoints
do not advertise their existence.

---

## Never trust a client-supplied identifier

```ts
// ❌ BANNED — write-side IDOR: anyone can target any record
const recordId = formData.recordId;

// ✅ REQUIRED — derive it from the signed/encrypted token
const bound = JSON.parse(decryptToken(formData.token));
const recordId = bound.recordId;
```

- "The page already validated it" is **not** validation. The API is directly reachable;
  client-side checks are decoration.
- Never write a "lenient mode" that logs a validation failure and continues anyway.
- If a value decides *which record* is read or written, it must come from a server-verified
  source, not the request body.

---

## Crypto

- **AES-256-GCM only.** Never CBC — it is unauthenticated, malleable, and enables padding
  oracles.
- Fresh random IV per encryption. Never reuse, never hardcode.
- Never return `error.message` from a decrypt path to the client — a distinguishable error
  is a decryption oracle. Log detail server-side, return a fixed opaque code.
- `Math.random()` is never acceptable for anything security-relevant. Use `crypto`.

---

## File uploads

```ts
// ❌ BANNED — path.join() normalizes "../", it does not block it
const filename = `${Date.now()}-${file.name}`;

// ✅ REQUIRED — allowlist the extension, generate the basename, assert containment
const ext = extname(basename(file.name)).toLowerCase();
if (!ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS.has(ext)) throw new Error("Unsupported file type");
const filename = `${Date.now()}-${crypto.randomUUID()}${ext}`;
if (!resolve(uploadPath).startsWith(resolve(uploadsDir) + sep)) throw new Error("traversal");
```

Always cap file size and file count.

---

## Output escaping

- **JSON-LD** → `serializeJsonLd()` from `@/utils/seo-utils`. Never bare `JSON.stringify`
  in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: the HTML parser ends the script at the first `</script`
  regardless of JSON quoting.
- **HTML emails** → `escapeHtml()` from `@/utils/api/escape-html` on every interpolated
  value. Free text reaches staff inboxes as trusted internal mail.
- **CMS HTML** → DOMPurify before render, always.
- **Query interpolation** (SQL / query languages / URLs) → validate the format (`/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/`)
  or `encodeURIComponent`. Auth-gating is not a substitute.

---

## Logging

- Never log a token, key, or full auth response — not even on the error path.
- Never log request bodies, CRM records, or anything with names, emails, phones, or free
  text. GDPR applies; log an id and a status code instead.
- Never return upstream error bodies, `error.message`, stack traces, or decoded JWT
  payloads to a client.
- **`logger` does not save you**: `FORCE_LOGS=true` makes it a pass-through. Keep the
  secret out of the log call, do not merely gate it.

---

## TWO SCHEMAS: every migration runs against BOTH

This project splits the database into `public` (real data) and `dev` (mock data),
picked by `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SCHEMA`. See the `set-up-galabase-dev-schema`
skill for how it was built.

**Never write a migration for one schema.** The app reads `dev` in development,
so SQL applied only to `public` leaves the feature silently doing nothing — no
error, no failed write, PostgREST just ignores a column that is not there. It
has already cost an afternoon once.

```sql
-- ✅ REQUIRED — every statement, both schemas, explicitly named
alter table public.event_settings add column if not exists gate_open boolean;
alter table dev.event_settings    add column if not exists gate_open boolean;

notify pgrst, 'reload schema';

-- ❌ BANNED — unqualified, or one schema only
alter table event_settings add column if not exists gate_open boolean;
```

For a new TABLE, add it to `public`, then re-run the foreign-key and
RLS/policy/grant loops from the skill: they are idempotent and pick up whatever
is new, which beats hand-copying 27 policies.

Before handing any SQL to the user, check: does every statement name a schema, or
run for both? Would this leave one behind the other?

---

## The checked-in schema is the source of truth — update it in the SAME change

**Applies only if the project has a database.** Skip this section entirely if it does not.

Every schema change goes into the repo's schema or migration file **as you make it**, not
after someone asks. Find that file first — it differs per project (`schema.sql`,
`prisma/schema.prisma`, `drizzle/`, a `migrations/` folder). A table, column, index, access
policy or storage bucket that exists only in the live database is invisible: the next person
reads the file, believes it, and ships against a schema that is not real.

This has already bitten twice:

- A settings table was declared in the file but **never applied**, so the admin panel failed
  at runtime with "could not find the table".
- A storage bucket and several access policies existed **only** live, created by hand, so a
  fresh stack would have come up broken.

```sql
-- Append a dated, idempotent block. Never edit an earlier one: the live database
-- has already run it, so a silent edit makes the two diverge.
-- ── MIGRATION 2026-08-26 — what and why ────────────────────────────────────
alter table my_table add column if not exists my_column text;
```

Rules:
- **Idempotent always** — `if not exists`, `on conflict do nothing`, `drop policy if exists`
  before `create policy`. The file gets re-run whole.
- **A new table needs its access policy in the same block.** Row-level security enabled with
  no policy denies everyone, including staff. Writes then fail with a generic "write-failed"
  that looks like an app bug.
- **Realtime/subscriptions need the table registered** with whatever mechanism your database
  uses, or the subscription errors.
- **A new column may need a schema-cache reload** before the API stops 404-ing it — check
  whether your data layer caches the schema.
- **Changes made directly on a server count too** — record them here with a comment saying
  where they were applied, even when the SQL cannot run from a normal client.

## CMS collections

Every collection needs an explicit `access` block. The default in most CMSes is "any
authenticated user", which means any account can delete any other's content. Gate
`create`/`update`/`delete` on a role.

---

## Dependencies

- `npm audit` must be clean of critical/high in direct deps before release.
- Verify a major bump at **runtime**, not just with `tsc` — a library that drops its default
  export typechecks fine while being broken at runtime.
- Never bump a framework past what its plugins peer-accept; it breaks the build.

---

## Before marking security work done

- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors
- [ ] `npx next build` — succeeds
- [ ] Endpoint tested live: guarded routes reject, legitimate flow still works
- [ ] No secret in the diff, and none newly introduced to git history
- [ ] Never trigger an email-sending endpoint while testing; if unavoidable, send only to an
      address you control

## Testing against real data — ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION

**NEVER touch real data. No exceptions, no judgement calls, no "just this once".**

This is not a guideline. It was violated once and it wrote false information onto a real
customer's record. It must never happen again.

### The only permitted way to test anything that writes

1. **Create a dedicated test record first.** Its name MUST be unmistakably a test record, so
   no human could ever mistake it for real:
   ```
   TEST - <what you are testing> <date>
   ```
2. **Do all testing against that record and only that record.** Every write, email, and
   field update must reference it.
3. Never reuse, borrow, or "just use" an existing record — an id found in the source code,
   a log, a test file, or an earlier conversation is **NOT** permission to write to it.
   Assume every id refers to a real customer.

### Hard prohibitions

- ❌ NEVER write, update, or delete any production record that is not a `TEST -` record
  you created for this specific task.
- ❌ NEVER trigger an endpoint that writes to production using an id you did not mint yourself.
- ❌ NEVER send email to a real recipient. Send only to an address you control.
- ❌ A passing test is NEVER worth writing to production. If the only way to prove a change
  is a real write, **stop and ask** — do not decide it is acceptable.

### Preferred: do not write at all

Prove changes with:
- HTTP status codes (400/401/404 on rejection paths)
- isolated round-trip tests of the crypto/validation logic
- `tsc --noEmit` and `next build`
- page renders (GET only)

That covers virtually everything. Reach for a write only when nothing else can prove it,
and only on a `TEST -` record you created.
